# Erizur's NixOS configuration
My attempt at making a NixOS configuration, using KDE as a DE. With the help of [soyachin](https://github.com/soyachin/nixos-configuration) and [Grazen0](https://github.com/Grazen0/nixos-config)'s repos, I managed to make this work on my two current systems, with home-manager support using flakes.
